# Enterprise Features & Compliance

## Architecture Principles

This project follows enterprise-grade architecture principles:

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- **Infrastructure Pipeline**: Only handles Terraform deployments
- **Application Pipeline**: Only handles container builds and deployments  
- **Terraform Modules**: Each module has a single, well-defined purpose
- **Pipeline Templates**: Reusable components for specific tasks

### Separation of Concerns
- **Infrastructure** (`/infra`): Terraform modules and environment configurations
- **Application Code** (`/src`): 12-factor compliant Node.js application
- **CI/CD** (`/.azure-pipelines`): Pipeline definitions and templates
- **Documentation** (`/docs`): Setup guides and operational procedures

### 12-Factor App Compliance
- **Config**: Environment variables for all configuration
- **Dependencies**: Explicitly declared in package.json
- **Backing Services**: Treated as attached resources (Azure services)
- **Build/Release/Run**: Strict separation in pipeline stages
- **Processes**: Stateless application containers
- **Port Binding**: Application binds to PORT environment variable
- **Concurrency**: Horizontal scaling via Container Apps
- **Disposability**: Fast startup and graceful shutdown
- **Dev/Prod Parity**: Consistent environments across dev/staging/prod
- **Logs**: Treat logs as event streams (Application Insights)
- **Admin Processes**: Run as one-off processes in containers

### Immutable Infrastructure
- **No Manual Changes**: Everything deployed via Terraform
- **Version Controlled**: All infrastructure code in Git
- **Reproducible**: Environments can be recreated from code
- **Declarative**: Terraform describes desired state, not steps

### Declarative over Imperative
- **Terraform**: Declarative infrastructure definitions
- **Azure DevOps YAML**: Declarative pipeline configuration
- **Container Apps**: Declarative container configuration
- **No kubectl/az commands**: All changes via declarative manifests

### Least Privilege Access
- **Service Principals**: Minimal required permissions per environment
- **Environment Isolation**: Separate subscriptions/service connections
- **Secret Management**: Azure Key Vault integration
- **RBAC**: Role-based access control throughout

## Enterprise Compliance Features

### Change Management
- **Branch Policies**: Required reviews and status checks
- **Environment Gates**: Manual approvals for staging/production
- **Audit Trail**: Complete deployment history and approvals
- **Rollback Procedures**: Documented and tested rollback processes

### Security & Compliance
- **Security Scanning**: Checkov for infrastructure, container scanning
- **Secret Management**: Azure Key Vault for all sensitive data
- **Network Security**: Private endpoints and secure communication
- **Compliance Reporting**: Automated compliance checks and reporting

### Quality Assurance
- **Multi-Environment Testing**: Dev → Staging → Production flow
- **Automated Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, security tests
- **Performance Testing**: Load testing in staging environment
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive observability and alerting

### Operational Excellence
- **Infrastructure as Code**: All infrastructure version controlled
- **Automated Deployments**: Consistent, repeatable deployments
- **Monitoring & Alerting**: Proactive issue detection
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive operational procedures

## Environment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Purpose**: Developer testing and integration
- **Deployment**: Automatic on develop branch
